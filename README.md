# AIPI590 Computer Vision Project 1 - Scene Classification
This project outlines using pre-trained CNNs (ResNet and VGG) and Transfer Learning to classify weather images. 

## Data
We trained and tested on the Hardvard Dataverse Weather classification dataset, as found on Kaggle.
Weather Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset
